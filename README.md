# Breast_cancer_classification_neural_network
Developed a Python-based breast cancer classification system with enhanced accuracy through optimization tech-
niques like batch normalization, dropout regularization, and activation functions.
Utilized hyperparameter tuning and various optimizers. Employed pandas for feature analysis. Implemented and
fine-tuned an artificial neural network model using Keras
